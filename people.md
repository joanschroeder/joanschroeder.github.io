Hobbies that Joan participates in includes climbing, dance, singing, hiking, and ukelele. Throughout her life, she has been very immersed in the arts. Growing up as a kid, she did piano and art classes until high school where she pursued other forms of art. She participated in the theater, acapella, and dance programs at her high school and often did them many times a week. She also picked up ukelele in high school and would often sing with her practices. Throughout high school she also climbed three times a week. Climbing has been such a large part of her physical activity and social life, creating a hobby that would remain in her life for a long time. Joan competed in high school and currently competes for the Cal Poly climbing team.
