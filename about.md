### More Information

As Joan is interested in the sciences, she also expands her creativity elsewhere in her day to day life. She currently works at two climbing gyms and is a part of the CalPoly Climbing club. Going outdoors for climbing and climbing competitions is what she primarily trains for, but climbing is also a large part of her social life as well. Although climbing is a large part of her life, spending quality time with her friends is a large part as well. Joan often enjoys going to brunch, to the beach, or on local hikes with her close friends on sunny days. For quality alone time, Joan likes to sing, play the ukelele, lift weights, and watch TV. 

### Interests and Ambitions

A couple years into college, Joan started to look into the medical field as a profession. Being interested in the medical world has always been an interest for her since her high school biology class, but she was unsure whether to take it to the pharmaceutical or medical school route. After looking into it, she realized she didn't have to choose one or the other. Once Joan discovered the occupation of being a physician's assistant, she started gather her plans to work towards applying to PA school. This included lots of research, interviews, and program searching, and even led to the desire of a major change to biology. Her goals towards becoming a physician's assistant will take a lot of work, but can be achieved if she works hard in an organized manner.
