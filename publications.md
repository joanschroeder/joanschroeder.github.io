Joan has a goal to become a physician's assistant, specializing in pediatric surgery. A couple years into college, Joan started to look into the medical field as a profession. Being interested in the medical world has always been an interest for her since her high school biology class, but she was unsure whether to take it to the pharmaceutical or medical school route. After looking into it, she realized she didn't have to choose one or the other. Once Joan discovered the occupation of being a physician's assistant, she started gather her plans to work towards applying to PA school. This included lots of research, interviews, and program searching, and even led to the desire of a major change to biology. Her goals towards becoming a physician's assistant will take a lot of work, but can be achieved if she works hard in an organized manner.
